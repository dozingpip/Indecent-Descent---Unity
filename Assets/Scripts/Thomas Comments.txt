Some notes on parsing
When you see an open parenthesis '(', the path builder should add a Vector3 of its location to a stack
When it sees a period '.' it will peek at and move to the position at the top of the stack and then begin going down the next path from the junction
When it sees a close parenthesis ')' it will pop the top of the stack.
