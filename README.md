# Indecent-Descent
The player is falling from one procedurally generated floor of a tower to the next, trying to get as many collectibles on a floor as they can before falling to the next one. Enemies will attack from the walls. There will be less places to land the farther you go, and the number of enemies also increases. The floor layouts are randomly generated, and there are multiple types of platforms. They must hop across gaps and over enemy attacks as they get fall endlessly through the tower.  The player can withstand 3 hits from enemies before losing the game.
